<p class="text">Learn how to make <strong><em>The Best Lasagna</em></strong> complete with a homemade hearty beef and sausage sauce, ricotta, layered with lots of mozzarella and parmesan. With this step-by-step instructions you are guaranteed the perfect lasagna every time!</p><p>I've been making lasagna for a long time. I think by this point I can call myself a master in the art of layering to create the perfect ratio of sauce to meat to noodles to cheesiness! Lasagna is the perfect <strong><em>baked pasta dish</em></strong>. Each bite is loaded with comforting warm flavors.</p><p>Another amazing part about this recipe is that it's also great to prep, freeze, and pop in the oven for those busy weeknights. Spend a Sunday making a freezer full of lasagnas that will keep everyone happy for a month! Now it's time for the most important decision: will you take an edge piece or a center piece?</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Italian sausage-</strong>Choose mild or hot, whichever you prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>Ground beef-</strong>Use lean or extra lean so you don't have to drain any fat.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion and garlic-</strong>Use as much onion and garlic as you like.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomatoes-</strong>Use a can each of crushed tomatoes, tomatoe sauce and tomatoe paste.</li>
    <li><strong>Water-</strong>Use enough as you need to get your preferred consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar-</strong>Use as much, as little, or none at all if you prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings-</strong>Fresh basil and parsley, fennel seeds, and Italian seasoning.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt and pepper-</strong>Season to taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Ricotta-</strong>You can use fromage blanc, cottage cheese, or mascarpone instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg-</strong>This is what will bind your cheese mixture together. Use 1 large egg.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles-</strong>Use "oven ready" noodles to save time.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese-</strong>Parmesan and mozzarella. Use as much as you like!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>Brown the sausage, beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meats are fully cooked. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the cheese mixture:</strong>In a medium size bowl, mix the ricotta, egg, and parsley together.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong>Preheat the oven to 375F. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce in the bottom of your lasagna dish. Arrange 4 noodles over the sauce, then spread 1/2 the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Layer 1/3 of the mozzarella, another 1 1/2 cups meat mixture, 1/4 cup Parmesan, then repeat the layers with the remaining ingredients finishing with mozzarella and parmesan.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong>Cover the lasagna with foil. Spray the side of the foil facing the lasagna with cooking spray to avoid sticking. Bake for 25 minutes, remove the foil, then bake for another 25 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Extra tips</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Take the time to simmer the sauce for the full one hour and a half. The longer you simmer this sauce, the better it will taste. Trust me.</li>
    <li>Make sure you find some “oven-ready” noodles. They cook up perfectly with the sauce in the oven without getting over-done.</li>
    <li>Do you have some fresh herbs that need to be used up? Feel free to add some to your homemade sauce as it simmers. Make sure you remove them before layering the lasagna if they aren't chopped.</li>
    <li>You'll want to end up with 3 layers of noodles for this recipe. Make sure the layers or sauce and ricotta aren't too thick so that your slices will stand up instead of droop.</li>
    <li>Get yourself a good lasagna pan. These are designed to fit the noodles perfectly. No more snapping noodles to make them fit!</li>
