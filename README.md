# odin-recipes
This project entails me showcasing my current understanding for the application of HTML which I have learned through The Odin Project, by developing a website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The skills presented in this website will consist of applying ordered/unordered list, working with text, links and images.
